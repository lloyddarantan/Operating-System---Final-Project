# Operating-System---Final-Project
Endterm Assessment - Operating System

**Description:**
This project is a simple banking system simulation built for the Operating System final project.
It allows users to create an account, log in securely using a PIN, and perform basic banking operations such as depositing, withdrawing, and checking balance, all through a console-based interface.

**How to Run the Program**
1. Create an Account
- Enter your first name, last name, and a 4-digit PIN.
- The system will then generate and display your account name and bank number.

2. Login
- Enter your bank number and PIN to access your account.

3. Choose an Option (1–4)
- 1: Deposit money
- 2: Withdraw money
- 3: Check balance

4. Repeat or Exit
- After completing a transaction, the program will ask if you want to perform another action.
- Type “yes” to return to the main menu or “no” to exit the program.
